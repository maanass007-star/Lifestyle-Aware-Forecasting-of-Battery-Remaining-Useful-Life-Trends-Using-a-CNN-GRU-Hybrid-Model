# Lifestyle-Aware-Forecasting-of-Battery-Remaining-Useful-Life-Trends-Using-a-CNN-GRU-Hybrid-Model.
Accurate prediction of Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is critical for improving reliability, safety, and lifecycle management in battery-powered systems such as electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and portable electronics.

This project proposes a Lifestyle-Aware RUL Prediction Framework using a hybrid CNN–GRU deep learning model that captures both:

Local degradation patterns (via Convolutional Neural Networks)

Long-term temporal dependencies (via Gated Recurrent Units)

By incorporating usage lifestyle patterns, the model improves prediction robustness under varying operating conditions.
